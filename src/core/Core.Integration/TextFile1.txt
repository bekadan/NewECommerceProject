1. Purpose of Core.Integration

Core.Integration is the abstraction layer for all external system interactions:

Payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)

Shipping/logistics APIs (DHL, FedEx, etc.)

Email/SMS services

Third-party inventory or pricing services

Any other external HTTP or messaging-based service

Why we need it:

Keeps your domain and application layers decoupled from external APIs

Makes unit testing easy, because you can mock these interfaces

Provides resilience and retry policies in one centralized place

Supports events and integration messages (e.g., publishing domain events to other services)
